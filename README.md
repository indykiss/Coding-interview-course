# Indy's AlgoCasts Progress

I'm backing up my progress on this course to my github. 
The original repo for this Udemy course is by Stephen Grider.

His repo is found here: https://github.com/StephenGrider/AlgoCasts

Good practice: Redo every algo at end of the course to solidify knowledge. 
I've redone through vowels, before matrix.

In general, practice by taking the directions, throw it into a repl.it and try it out.
